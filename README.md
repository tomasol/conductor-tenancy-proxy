You need to run Conductor locally. The easiest
way to get Conductor up and running quickly is using
docker-compose like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/Netflix/conductor.git
cd conductor/docker
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
When conductor is running execute the following command:


```
jest --testPathPattern test/e2e/sometest.js
```
To run all tests, use
```
npm run e2e
```
